# 📒 ️nobook

This is a simple notebook app focused on providing a delightful user experience.

It was supposed to be a microSaaS, but I'm currently facing some issues related to developing it. Dealing with content editable is overall pretty frustrating. I even tried to use some libs, like `react-contenteditable` but it causes different unexpected behaviours.

### ⚙️ Technologies

I created this project using `Vite` as its plugin. Chose `React` as framework and used `Typescript`, of course.

Styled the project using `styled-components`, used `uuidv4` for unique IDs to each notebook and `react-router-dom` to manage routing.
